	I chose the topic of Lilith not only because I really enjoyed the story telling that we had in class and wanted to create a newer sort of my own midrash on a story that came from midrash, but also because I grew up in a Catholic family and when we were young we learned the story of creation. The story was always told to us as follows:  God created the world with all the animals in pairs so they had partners, and he made Adam, by himself. Later God noticed that Adam was lonely since he didn't have a partner, like all of the other animals. God then decided to make Adam a partner he put Adam into a very deep sleep and took one of his ribs to create a partner for him, this perfect partner was called Eve.  My paper is about the alternate story that is known that instead of Adam being created first and Eve later, Adam was created at the same time as his partner was created, her name was known as Lilith. In Genesis 1:26-27 the Bible states that Adam and his partner were created together, like the other animals, since everything was done in pairs, when he made one sex of animal he created the opposite as it's mate. The first story that I was taught as a child held that even though all of the animals were created in pairs for each other Adam wasn't created with one.  These are the two different stories that are somewhat known about creation, the one in Genesis 2:21 like the story I was told as a child in Bible study, where Adam was created first then Eve later; as well as the alternate story in Genesis 1:26-27 where Adam and his partner, who later became known as Lilith, were created together. Since there are two different instances of the creation story there were problems that came about when many set out to read the passages. These two different stories in the Bible made ancient rabbis very uncomfortable; since the Bible is supposed to be the written word of God.  The rabbis decided to create midrash on both of the stories to make them different so as not to contradict each other. In the Torah within the interpretation of these two passages this is how Lilith, as a separate and different person from Adam and Eve, was born.  

            Within the Alphabet of Ben Sira, which is a very old, sophisticated Hebrew, work is where I was able to find some information about where Lilith came from.  Although the Alphabet of Ben Sira is viewed as a mostly satirical work, it does contain the necessary information I needed to start my journey of trying to uncover the ideas revolving around Lilith and where she came from.  Within the narrative Lilith is called out to have been the first attempt at a partner for Adam. Upon further investigation the story that follows is what I could piece together about Lilith.  Adam and Lilith were created together but instead of having a good relationship like what should be a happy couple they couldn't get along together.  Adam and Lilith's partnership did not last long because of their many problems.  All of their problems were from the partners fighting most of the time because they could not see eye to eye.  The most problematic, it seemed, of the couple's troubles that was mentioned in my research was that they had many disagreements about the way things should be done in the bedroom department.  Adam always wanted the more dominant position but Lilith also wanted to take control and have that dominant position, they couldn't compromise and let each other have their way once in a while.  When the two could not come to a decent compromise Lilith left Adam, and she cursed God's name while doing so.  When God found out about this problem between the two he became very mad, and he sent three angels to go and get Lilith, telling the angels that if she would not come back to her husband willingly that they must make her come back to him forcefully.  The three angels then set off on their journey to retrieve Lilith only to be stopped when they finally found her. When they arrived at where she had chosen to stay for the time being the angels tried to convince Lilith to go back to Adam, her husband, she would not go back.  Even when she was told that if she didn't go willingly they had permission to take her back forcefully.  When the three angels tried to force her into leaving and going back to Adam, they failed yet again, even with their higher powers.  When they couldn't get Lilith to return either way willingly or forcefully; Lilith and the three angels came up with a deal.  A bargain was proposed and later agreed upon between the three angels and Lilith.  This deal started out with Lilith explaining to the angels that she knew what God had made her for.  Even though this may not have actually been what she was really created for.  Lilith stated that God only made her to make babies very sick and die from fatal diseases; this was supposed to be her job for the rest of her existence.  The job that she thought she was to carry out she didn't like.  She went on to explain further that she was only allowed to infect the newborn babies when they were eight days old.  She told the angels that she would leave all babies alone IF they were to wear an amulet that had all three of the angel's names on it.  But if the newborn babies did not have that particular amulet she would be able to, with the boys, infect and make them sick until they turned eight days old; if the newborn was to be a girl however she would be able to infect and make the girls sick until they turned twelve days old.  Surprisingly this was good enough for the angels because they agreed and left her where she was and returned to heaven to report to God.  Eventually after many different re-tellings of both of these stories there have been a lot that has changed.  Lilith eventually became known as a demoness that seduced men in their sleep and spawned evil demonic children from those rendezvous.  This would in theory make her the perfect partner for God's fallen angel Lucifer.  

In modern times Lilith is seen as this sort of right hand demon to the devil.  I think that this stems from the thought that Lilith is, as an idea, a good partner for Lucifer.  Since Lilith can spawn demons and Lucifer needs a partner of some sort like everything else in the world, why wouldn't something like this make sense?  This is now how she is seen in many different ways as Lucifer's right hand demoness.  Although all of this is speculation and it all comes from the need to make sense of contradictions within the Bible, it is an interesting theory that is now widely used in the media.  There are many different places where the demon Lilith comes up, Supernatural a television show that is on CW, is a very good example for how the mainstream media retells stories that they see as entertaining for the public.  The television show takes the story of Lilith to a different level.  She is seen as a wild and very independent demon from Lucifer.  Even though he is her "boss" she is still able to go and do whatever it is that she wants to do without the fear of being in trouble by her superior, like she was by God and Adam.  In the television series Supernatural there are many different mythic creatures and beings, like demons, angels, God, Lucifer, ghosts and other such things that for children go "bump" in the night.  This made a sort of stereotype against all of the things that any believer of a higher power would and can believe in.  It kind of makes everyone as a whole wonder whether any or part of it is even real or okay to believe in.  Lilith as I have covered comes from midrash and would seemingly discredit any or all parts of the beings that could be seen as real by some people.  

	Although there are many ways that Lilith is portrayed there is another way to view her, as a feminist icon that helped many women to start thinking like an individual rather than just as a spouse.  What I got from my research is that in the midrash from the ancient rabbis Lilith became independent because she came up with her own ideas and thoughts, that were separate from those thoughts and ideas that Adam had, and started acting upon them.  Since she had all of this newfound individuality and Adam could not support her ideas and individuality she left him.  The idea that men should be the only supporter and care provider for their family and that women should only care for the children of the home, as well as take care of the home they share; like do laundry, clean the house as well as prepare all meals in the home, in my opinion a very outdated practice.  This practice was used in older times when women only knew the role of homemaker and housewife.  Lilith, by becoming her own person with her own individual ideas sort of paved the way for many women that were held back and oppressed by the outdated idea that men must be relied on for everything.  Women with this newfound hope for individuality went out to try to get many different things for themselves.  The women went out to get jobs and higher education or education alone.  This made way for more jobs for others since the women now would need to seek others to care for their children and take care of their homes so that they could go to work and school without worrying about anything at home that they may have normally needed to take care of on their own.  Getting jobs, finding work and going to school weren't the only things that were affected in the world at this time of an individuality movement, home lives were also affected dramatically.  Schools started receiving more and more female applicants, since women not only wanted to get jobs to help support their families but also to better themselves intellectually.  The home lives of the women that did want to go out and better themselves, I think started to deteriorate because after this movement by independent women caused strained relationships, more arguments and fights between spouses.  In my opinion this is because the men, that had wives that wanted to go and better themselves,  thought that all women shouldn't have their own ideas or any individuality, that they should all "stay in their place" at home and take care of the men.  Another thought I had for a reason for the men being upset at the women for wanting to better themselves was that the men could feel emasculated, since the women were also providing for their families as well, they maybe weren't good enough or didn't make enough money to provide for their families on their own.  The other way that men could feel emasculated would be that if the woman were to be more able to get and keep a job and the man were to not have a job, not be able to get one, or even have had a job but lost it would have to stay at home with the children to take care of them and the home as well as prepare meals for the other spouse, essentially taking over the spouse's old duties.  From my own experience this last reason really does put a strain on not only on the relationship between the partners but also a strain on the male partner's confidence.  This sort of strain on men and relationships with men makes for an unstable relationship and home as well.  I think that the idea of individuality for women is a great thing, but it also could have inevitably led to much of the divorce rate now.

	In conclusion there may not be any real validity to Lilith as a real person that was created by God, but there have been many good or entertaining things that have come from the midrash that created her.  Lilith, even though she came from almost nothing but midrash on a story that didn't make any sense because it was a contradiction within the Bible.  She has turned into so much more for women everywhere.  Lilith not only paved the way for the modern feminist movement and created a new way of thinking for all women.  She also makes a good character for many different types of media that make her different in each one.  Since she isn't really considered by many to be a real person she made a difference all the same.  I liked researching and speaking about this topic because, for myself, even though there are many different women that were actually real people that can be credited for many parts of the feminist movement she made a difference for many women even though she isn't real just an idea.
